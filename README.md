# Day-Planner

## Task

For this assignment we were tasked with creating a day planner in which to store a specific days schedule. There are timeblocks from 9am through 5pm in which you can enter a task and save it to local storage. Along with this the timeblocks change color as the day goes on. Grey for past times, red for present, and green for future. When a new day starts the planner resets!
